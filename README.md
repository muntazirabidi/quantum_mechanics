# Quantum Mechanics Course - Spring 2023 - Habib University

Welcome to the Quantum Mechanics course offered at Habib University in Spring 2023! This GitHub repository is a central hub for all course materials, including lecture notes, books, resources, example sheets, solutions, exams, and quizzes. As an instructor, I will regularly update this repository to ensure all materials are up-to-date and accessible to students.

## Course Overview
This course introduces the principles and mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics. Topics covered include wave-particle duality, Schr√∂dinger's equation, quantum states, operators, and quantum superposition. Throughout the semester, we will explore the development of quantum mechanics, its applications, and its impact on our understanding of the physical world.

## Prerequisites
Students are expected to have a solid foundation in classical mechanics, calculus, linear algebra, and differential equations. A basic understanding of complex numbers and probability theory will also be beneficial.

## Repository Structure
This repository is organized into the following directories:
- `Notes/:` Contains PDF files of the lecture notes for each class.
- `Books_and_resources/:` Features a curated list of recommended textbooks, articles, and online resources to complement the course material.
- `Example_sheets/:` Includes example sheets with practice problems and exercises to reinforce the concepts discussed in the lectures. I also include solutions to the problems presented in the example sheets.
- `Exams/:` Contains midterm and final exams
- `Quizzes/:` Quizzes to assess students' understanding of the material.

## Getting Started
To start, clone this repository to your local machine or download the files as a ZIP archive. Regularly check for updates; new materials will be added throughout the semester.
